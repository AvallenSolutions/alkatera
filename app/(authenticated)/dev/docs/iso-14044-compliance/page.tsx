### Current Implementation Analysis

**File**: \`/app/(authenticated)/products/[id]/lca/initiate/page.tsx\`

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Functional unit explicitly captured with validation (minimum 10 characters)
- ✅ System boundary selection enforced (cradle-to-gate vs cradle-to-grave)
- ✅ Goal and scope confirmation creates immutable audit record
- ✅ Mandatory checkpoint before data entry (ISO 14044 compliance gateway)
- ✅ User-friendly guidance on functional unit definition with examples
- ✅ Clear documentation that definitions cannot be changed after confirmation
- ✅ Workflow audit trail via \`lcaWorkflow.ts\` with \`logWorkflowAction()\`
- ✅ Versioning support for LCA extensions (cradle-to-gate → cradle-to-grave)

**Current Functional Unit Capture:**
\`\`\`typescript
const functionalUnit = \`\${product.unit_size_value} \${product.unit_size_unit}\`;
// Example: "700ml of packaged beverage to a retail customer"
\`\`\`

**Current System Boundary Options:**
1. **Cradle-to-Gate**: Raw material extraction → Manufacturing
2. **Cradle-to-Grave**: Full life cycle including distribution, use, end-of-life

**Gaps Identified:**

❌ **Missing: Intended Application**
- No field to capture why the LCA is being conducted
- Required by ISO 14044 Section 4.2.2.a

❌ **Missing: Intended Audience**
- No explicit capture of who will use the LCA results
- Required by ISO 14044 Section 4.2.2.c

❌ **Missing: Comparative Assertion Declaration**
- No field to declare if LCA will be used for product comparisons
- Critical for Section 6 critical review requirements

❌ **Missing: Assumptions and Limitations Documentation**
- No structured capture of study assumptions at goal/scope phase
- Required by ISO 14044 Section 4.2.3.7

❌ **Missing: Data Quality Requirements**
- Data quality addressed downstream but not defined at goal/scope
- ISO 14044 requires upfront data quality requirements definition

❌ **Missing: Cut-off Criteria**
- No explicit capture of materiality thresholds or exclusions
- Required by ISO 14044 Section 4.2.3.3.3

### Compliance Rating: ✅ COMPLIANT (with enhancements required)

**Justification**: Core requirements (functional unit, system boundary) are implemented with strong workflow controls. Missing elements are supplementary but important for full ISO compliance.

\`\`\`sql
CREATE TABLE data_provenance_trail (
  provenance_id uuid PRIMARY KEY,
  organization_id uuid NOT NULL,
  user_id uuid NOT NULL,
  source_description text NOT NULL,
  document_type text NOT NULL,
  storage_object_path text NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  verification_status verification_status_enum NOT NULL,
  created_at timestamptz NOT NULL
);
\`\`\`

**Key Features:**
- Permanent evidence retention (deletes blocked by trigger)
- Chain of custody from source document to calculation
- Verification workflow (unverified → verified → rejected)
- Audit history for status changes
- RLS security preventing cross-organisation access

✅ **Data Quality Index (DQI) Implementation:**
\`\`\`typescript
// Three-tier quality scoring
- High Confidence (80-100): Primary data with full traceability
- Medium Confidence (50-79): Mix of primary and secondary data
- Modelled/Estimate (<50): Industry averages and estimates
\`\`\`

✅ **Three-Tier Waterfall Data Source Hierarchy:**
1. Staging factors (curated, high-quality)
2. OpenLCA cache (validated secondary data)
3. OpenLCA live query (generic database)

✅ **Data Source Tracking:**
- Every material linked to data source
- Supplier product tracking for supply chain transparency
- Ingredient selection audit trail

**Gaps Identified:**

⚠️ **DQI Scoring Methodology Not Documented:**
- How is 80 vs 50 score determined?
- What criteria contribute to score?
- Not aligned with pedigree matrix approach (Weidema & Wesnaes 1996)

❌ **Missing Pedigree Matrix Elements:**
- Reliability: Not explicitly scored
- Completeness: Not quantified
- Temporal correlation: Partially tracked (created_at)
- Geographical correlation: Country tracked but not scored
- Further technological correlation: Not assessed

❌ **No Uncertainty Quantification:**

❌ **Missing Temporal Coverage:**
- No explicit "data reference year" field
- Cannot assess if data is current or outdated
- Age of data not factored into DQI

❌ **Technology Representativeness Not Assessed:**
- Is data from similar technology?
- Process-specific vs industry average?
- Representative of market mix?

### Compliance Rating: ⚠️ PARTIAL COMPLIANCE

**Justification**: Excellent provenance infrastructure and data source hierarchy. DQI component implemented but scoring methodology needs alignment with ISO data quality principles and established pedigree matrix approaches.

## 6. Allocation Methodology Compliance (ISO 14044 Section 4.3.4)

### ISO 14044 Allocation Hierarchy

**Mandatory Sequence:**

**Step 1**: Avoid allocation wherever possible by:
- Subdivision of processes
- System expansion to include additional functions

**Step 2**: If allocation cannot be avoided:
- Partition inputs/outputs to reflect underlying **physical relationships**

**Step 3**: If physical relationships alone cannot be established:
- Partition based on **other relationships** (e.g., economic value)

### Current Implementation Analysis

**File**: \`/lib/allocation-engine.ts\`

**Current Approach:**
\`\`\`typescript
/**
 * Allocation Philosophy: "Model the Business"
 *
 * Logic:
 * 1. Fetch Total Facility Emissions (numerator)
 * 2. Fetch Total Production Volume (denominator) - ALL products
 * 3. Calculate Intensity Factor = Emissions / Volume
 * 4. Apply to Product: Product_Impact = Intensity * Product_Volume
 */

intensityFactor = totalEmissions / totalProductionVolume;
productImpact = intensityFactor * volumePerUnit;
\`\`\`

**Strengths:**

✅ **Systematic Allocation Approach:**
- Production volume used as allocation key
- Physically meaningful (volume-based for beverage industry)
- Consistent application across products

✅ **Documented Philosophy:**
- Clear explanation of allocation rationale
- "Model the Business" philosophy stated

✅ **Database Functions:**
- \`get_facility_production_volume()\` RPC function
- Aggregates all production for allocation denominator

**Gaps Identified:**

❌ **ISO 14044 Hierarchy Not Followed:**
- No attempt at subdivision documented
- No consideration of system expansion
- Jumps directly to allocation without justification

❌ **Physical Relationships Not Fully Explored:**
- Volume used but other physical parameters ignored
- Energy content relationships not considered
- Mass relationships not evaluated

❌ **No Economic Allocation Fallback:**
- What if volume inappropriate (very different product values)?
- No implementation of economic value-based allocation

❌ **Missing Allocation Documentation:**
- Why is subdivision not possible?
- Why is system expansion not appropriate?
- Justification for volume vs mass vs energy not provided

❌ **No Multi-functional Process Guidance:**
- How to handle co-products (e.g., biogas from waste)?
- Allocation vs system expansion decision tree missing
- By-product vs co-product distinction not clear

❌ **No Sensitivity Analysis on Allocation:**
- Impact of allocation method choice not quantified
- Alternative allocation scenarios not explored
- ISO 14044 recommends testing allocation impacts

### Compliance Rating: ⚠️ PARTIAL COMPLIANCE

**Justification**: Allocation implemented and physically meaningful for single-product facilities. However, ISO 14044 hierarchy (avoid, physical, economic) not demonstrably followed. Missing documentation of why allocation necessary and sensitivity to allocation choices.

**RECOMMENDATION**: Add allocation justification documentation and implement sensitivity checks.

2. External expert review
3. Review by interested parties (stakeholder panel)

**Critical Review Scope:**
- Goal and scope consistent with intended application
- Methods consistent with ISO 14044
- Data appropriate and reasonable
- Interpretation reflects limitations
- Study report transparent and consistent

### Current Implementation Analysis

**Gaps Identified:**

❌ **NO CRITICAL REVIEW WORKFLOW:**

## 12. Conclusion

The Alkatera LCA platform demonstrates **strong foundational compliance** with ISO 14044 in goal/scope definition, data collection, and data provenance. The implementation shows sophisticated understanding of LCA principles with excellent workflow management and security.

**Critical Gap**: The **Life Cycle Interpretation phase (Section 4.5) is non-compliant** and represents a blocking issue for any ISO 14044 certification claims. This is the highest priority for development.

**Secondary Gaps**: Enhanced goal and scope documentation, allocation methodology justification, and impact assessment methodology documentation are required for full compliance.

**Timeline to ISO 14044 Compliance:**
- Phase 1 (Critical Blockers): **1-2 months** → Minimum certification readiness
- Phase 2 (Full Compliance): **3-4 months** → External review readiness
- Phase 3 (Advanced): **5-6 months** → Comparative assertion readiness

The platform is well-positioned to achieve ISO 14044 compliance with focused development on the interpretation phase and documentation enhancements. The existing infrastructure provides excellent building blocks for a world-class, standards-compliant LCA tool.
