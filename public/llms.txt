# Alkatera

> Sustainability, Distilled. The first ecological intelligence engine for the global drinks industry.

Alkatera is a specialized sustainability SaaS platform designed for breweries, distilleries, wineries, and soft drink producers. It moves beyond basic carbon accounting to provide a full-spectrum environmental stewardship tool that quantifies the "impact per litre" of beverages.

## Core Platform Stages
- **Analyse:** Dissects the "liquid journey" by standardising raw inputs against global frameworks (GHG Protocol, ISO 14064/14067) to reveal the true composition of a brand's footprint.
- **Calculate:** Executes complex, audit-ready calculations for carbon equivalents in packaging (glass, aluminium, kegs) and location-specific water scarcity indices.
- **Strategise:** Enables brands to move from reporting to action by building resilient supply chains and setting Science-Based Targets (SBTi) to regenerate terroir.

## Key Features & Specialisms
- **Ecological Intelligence:** Deep-tier mapping of agricultural dependencies including soil health and climate stability for key ingredients (Barley, Agave, Grapes, Cane).
- **Water Stewardship (AWARE Protocol):** Uses the AWARE protocol to provide location-specific water impact scores, validating true stewardship in high-volume production.
- **Greenwashing Protection:** Real-time asset scanning against the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers (DMCC) Act and the EU Green Claims Directive to ensure marketing claims are legally defensible.
- **Full Spectrum Traceability:** Tracks performance beyond carbon, including waste stream management and biodiversity impact mapping.
- **B-Corp Framework Integration:** Automated data mapping to the B Impact Assessment (Environment section) to streamline certification and maintenance.
- **Terroir Regeneration:** Tools specifically designed to track and drive value back into the agricultural "terroir" that beverage products depend on.

## Technical Standards
- **Reporting Frameworks:** TCFD, CSRD, SECR, and GRI.
- **Compliance:** Audit-ready outputs for global regulatory bodies.
- **Target Metrics:** Quantified impact per litre of finished product.

## Product Roadmap
- **Status:** Pre-Launch / Early Access.
- **Availability:** Full launch scheduled for Q1 2026.
